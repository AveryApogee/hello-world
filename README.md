Hello world!

My name is Avery. I'm a nonbinary computer scientist and mathematician. In my free time I love to debate philosophy, read dystopic novels, play video and board games, practice poetry and sketching, do yoga, take hikes, watch anime, listen to heavy metal music, and learn more about the strange world we inhabit!

Personal traits: natural leader, fast learner, friendly, loyal, night owl, self-motivated, curious, extroverted.
